The PDO trigger method for this project will be time driven triggering.
This means that PDO messages will be transmitted after a centain period of time.
Other possible trigger methods are:
 - Event driven (change of state)
 - Master polling
 - Synchronized (group polling)
 
Due to time constrains and also because time driven is mostly used in our company,
only time driven communication will be implemented at this time.

In the time driven communication the PDO is transmitted when event timer reaches zero. So if PDO event timer is set to 100 ms, the PDO will be transmitted every 100 ms.

As per CANopen standard, the RPDO communication parameters start at 0x1400 and mapping at 1600.
