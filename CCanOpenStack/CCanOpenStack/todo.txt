TODO:
- Implement data types and access types

- Create a test that uses nodes that can send and receive PDO messages
- Create a test that uses nodes that support PDO mapping
- Create a blueprint for default object dictionary
- Object dictionary 0x1F80 NMT Start-up bit
- Reset communication and reset device functions. Also add them to nmt_slave.c to be called when appropriated command is received.
- Implement functions that set the "current_state" variable in nmt_slave.c.
- Transmit boot up message (transmitted after NMT initialization is finished, when going into NMT pre-operational)

DONE:
- Create NMT tests
- Create node reset tests
- NMT processing

- Create functions that create and parse SDO messages
  + Add SDO abort codes enum
  + Add SDO client abort transfer message test
  + Add tests for server SDO messages
- Somehow create and SDO server - one with OD and listening to CAN bus for SDO message and responsds
- Create a CANopen node structure that holds object dictionary.
