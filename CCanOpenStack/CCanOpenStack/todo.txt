TODO:
- Create functions that handle SDO interaction
- Create a test that tests SDO interaction by creating "nodes", attaching them to can_bus and sending SDO requests from master to slaves.
- Create a test that uses nodes that can send and receive PDO messages
- Create a test that uses nodes that support PDO mapping
- Create a blueprint for default object dictionary

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE:
- Create a CANopen node structure that holds object dictionary.
- Remove objects structure array from od.c, and instead pass a pointer to each od.c function, so that they could be used with any object dictionary from any node.
