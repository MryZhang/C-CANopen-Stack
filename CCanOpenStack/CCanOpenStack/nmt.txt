NMT:
COB-ID base is 0.

NMT states:
- (Power-On/Reset -> Initialization)
- Initialization
- Pre-Operational
- Operational
- Stopped
- (Reset Node -> Power-On/Reset)
- (Reset Communication -> Initialization)

How it happens:
Device boots up, goes into Initialization.
Initializes entire application and CAN/CANopen interfaces.
Transmits boot up message.
Switches to pre-operational.
---
Master node can tell nodes to switch to any of three modes: pre-operational, operational and stopped.
Master node can also tell nodes to "Reset communication" or "Reset node". After reset node sends boot up message and stays in pre-operational.


Communication that can happen during different NMT states:
- Initialization: Boot-up message
- Pre-operational: SDO, EMCY, SYNC/TIME, heartbeat/nodeguard, NMT
- Operational:     SDO, EMCY, SYNC/TIME, heartbeat/nodeguard, NMT, PDO
- Stopped: heartbeat/nodeguard, NMT

Basically operational state differs from pre-operational only by PDO capability.

Node auto-start:
Object Dictionary entry 1F80 is implemented to report that the node is auto- starting


-------------------
NMT message structure:
2 bytes
byte 0: command:
 - 1 = Operational
 - 2 = Stopped
 - 128 = Pre-operational
 - 129 = Reset Node
 - 130 = Reset Communication
byte 1: destination:
 - 0 (broadcast)
 - node ID
